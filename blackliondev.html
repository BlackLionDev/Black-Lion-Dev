		<h1> Hello, World! </h1>

		<br><p>My name is Aaron Wilson, but you can call me Sam! I recently began teaching myself to code about 5 days ago (August 18th, 2016), and I couldn't be more excited to share my journey with you!
		<p>I will be using this website as a barometer of my progress with the goal being to create an awesome, dynamic personal website & blog that I can share with the world, all while documenting my progress in the process.
		<p>This is about as basic as basic gets because I am a beginner, but my hope is that, as I learn more about the wonderful world of computer programming, my website will grow as I do.
		<p>I will be adding new features, design ideas, animations and everything in between day-by-day until I finally have something that I can be proud of, and I will be blogging about it in the process.
		<p>So, without further ado, let's get coding!
